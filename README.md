# HW06 Description
For this assignment I picked the first 3 sentences of the country hit song 29 by Carly Pearce. I made this piece as kind of a consolation price for not being able to afford to see her live in concert a couple of weeks ago.
  
I chose the words to show up in a clockwise motion, in a circle, with the number (age) 29 starkly in the middle of the canvas. There were a couple of meanings behind this layout: 1) time — the song sings about Pearce’s expectations for herself at that age and how she felt pressured to have been at a different stage in life, yet her life actually looked so much more different then she expected 2) cake — the circular shape with the age in the middle also felt like a great symbolism for a birthday cake, in which a regular birthday may be full of positive expectations and wishes, this age was a stressful and pressuring one for her.
  
The most difficult part was to figure out how to make the words go in a circle. At first I was trying to do it via pi, but I had to switch to degrees for things to make sense to me. Otherwise, it was a lot of trial and error, just seeing what different ways of trying to determine the positioning of each new word would look like. I had to brush up on some long gone high school knowledge of sin and cos to understand the research on potential solutions I could be using. Otherwise, of course, referring to the string tutorials on our class website has been extremely valuable and helpful.
